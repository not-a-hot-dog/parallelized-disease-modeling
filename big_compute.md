# Big Compute

## Description of Parallel Application
Technical description of the parallel application, programming models, platform and infrastructure
OpenMP was used to parallelize computations in our model.
We compared execution on the Odyssey cluster against an AWS t2.2xlarge instance.

## Technical Description
Technical description of the software design, code baseline, dependencies, how to use the code, and system and environment needed to reproduce your tests
In order to run on odyssey, it is as simple as running `python run.py`

## Performance Evaluation
Performance evaluation (speed-up, throughput, weak and strong scaling) and discussion about overheads and optimizations done
