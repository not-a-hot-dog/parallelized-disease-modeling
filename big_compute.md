# Big Compute

## Description of Parallel Application
Technical description of the parallel application, programming models, platform and infrastructure
OpenMP was used to parallelize computations in our model.
We compared execution on the Odyssey cluster against an AWS t2.2xlarge instance.

## Technical Description
Technical description of the software design, code baseline, dependencies, how to use the code, and system and environment needed to reproduce your tests
In order to run on the cluster, the required directory structure is shown below:

```
data/
|  beta.csv
|  gamma.csv
|  S_init.csv
|  I_init.csv
|  R_init.csv
|  dS.csv
|  dI.csv
|  dR.csv
project_runs/
|  run.py
|  sir_data_omp.c
|  template.sh
|  timing.c
|  timing.h
```

The compiler `gcc/8.2.0-fasrc1` is used. OpenMP comes prebuilt with the compiler.
Python 3.7.7 is used.
Runs are executed on the default Odyssey operating system at the time of submission: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core).
Executing the model simple as running `python run.py`.
Slurm job parameters such as number of nodes, cores, runtime, and partition are updated in the `__main__` section of `run.py`.
Additionally, number of timesteps are updated in the same section.
The data matrices are generated by
