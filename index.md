With the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been an increase in work undertaken to model the spread of the virus. Our project adds a geographical dimension by modelling the US as a grid of square-miles, before applying a spatial version of the well-established SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model to estimate the spread of the virus across the US.

Our project employs the use of key **Big Data** and **Big Compute** concepts taught in this class, supplemented by context-specific knowledge about the disease transmission models.
